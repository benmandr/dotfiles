## Description
Waybar is providing necessary information, which helps daily: temperature, time, date, workspace, network and battery status.

Sway-fx has minimal styling to make the setup more pleasing to the eye, and uses `Super` as a "power" key - it triggers Rofi, and in combination with other keys, opens terminal, switches workspaces, splits views, etc.

Rofi is the center of control. Power actions, screenshots, screen recording, clipboard managenent and (not a perfect one, but does its work) translating.
